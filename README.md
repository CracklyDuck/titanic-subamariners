Final Report

* Report_TitanicAnalysis: Final summary of findings and insights retrieved from analysis of the data during Part I of the project. Report of results obtained of the implemented ML models and tuning of hyperparameters for chosen model.
  
* E4_Titanic_BestModel.ipynb: Enhances chosen model using grid search. Requieres data4training.csv and test.csv

------------------------------------------

Part I
* E4_Titanic_Exploratory_Analysis.ipynb: Contains detailed description of the dataset and initial data wrangling , which includes: missing values and outliers handling, one hot encoding of categorical values, data imputation techniques and duplicate instances elimination. Requires train.csv.


Part II
* E4_Titanic_ClassificationModels.ipynb: Contains detailed description of the implementation of Machine Learning models to predict whether a passeneger with specific characteristics survived the Titanic incident. Models included are KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. Requires data4training.csv and test.csv



Data

* data4training.csv: Modified train.csv ready to be used for the implementation of models.
